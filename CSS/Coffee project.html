        <h2>Coffee</h2>
        <p>Coffee lovers around the world who reach for their favorite morning brew probably aren’t thinking about its
            health benefits or risks. And yet this beverage has been subject to a long history of debate. In 1991 coffee
            was included in a list of possible carcinogens by the World Health Organization. By 2016 it was exonerated,
            as research found that the beverage was not associated with an increased risk of cancer; on the contrary,
            there was a decreased risk of certain cancers among those who drink coffee regularly once smoking history
            was properly accounted for. Additional accumulating research suggests that when consumed in moderation,
            coffee can be considered a healthy beverage. Why then in 2018 did one U.S. state pass legislation that
            coffee must bear a cancer warning label? Read on to explore the complexities of coffee.</p>

        <h2>Sources of</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Caffeine</li>
            <li>Vitamin B12</li>
            <li>Magnesium</li>
            <li>Plant chemicals: polyphenols including chlorogenic acid and quinic acid, and diterpenes including
                cafestol and kahweol</li>
            <p>One 8-ounce cup of brewed coffee contains about 95 mg of caffeine. A moderate amount of coffee is
                generally defined as 3-5 cups a day, or on average 400 mg of caffeine, according to the Dietary
                Guidelines for Americans.</p>
        </ul>
        <h2>Coffee and Health</h2>
        <p>Coffee is an intricate mixture of more than a thousand chemicals. [1] The cup of coffee you order from a
            coffee shop is likely different from the coffee you brew at home. What defines a cup is the type of coffee
            bean used, how it is roasted, the amount of grind, and how it is brewed. Human response to coffee or
            caffeine can also vary substantially across individuals. Low to moderate doses of caffeine (50–300 mg) may
            cause increased alertness, energy, and ability to concentrate, while higher doses may have negative effects
            such as anxiety, restlessness, insomnia, and increased heart rate. [2] Still, the cumulative research on
            coffee points in the direction of a health benefit. [3,4] Does the benefit stem from the caffeine or plant
            compounds in the coffee bean? Is there a certain amount of coffee needed a day to produce a health benefit?

        <h2>Make</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Follow directions on the coffee package and your coffee machine, but generally the ratio is 1-2
                        tablespoons of ground coffee per 6 ounces of water.</li>
                    <li>For optimal coffee flavor, drink soon after brewing. The beverage will lose flavor with time.</li>
                    <li>Use ground coffee within a few days and whole beans within two weeks.</li>
                </ul>
