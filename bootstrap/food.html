                    patties—usually ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun. The patty may

                <p>
                    Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened
                    wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients, which is then
                    baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.

                <h3>FRIED CHICKEN</h3>
                <p>
                    Southern fried chicken, also known simply as fried chicken, is a dish consisting of chicken pieces
                    that have been coated with seasoned flour or batter and pan-fried. The breading adds a crisp coating
                    or crust to the exterior of the chicken while retaining
                    juices in the meat.
